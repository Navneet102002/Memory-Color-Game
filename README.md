# Memory-Color-Game

This is a basic yet interesting game which makes your brain work.

The rules are simple.

After you start, a block pops with a sound. Remeber the colour of that block and click on.
If you click on the correct block, you progress further.
Now another block pops. You have to click on all the blocks that popped before the current one and at last one in the right order.
If you fail to remember the order and click on a wrong block, you lose!
The game starts again.

!!!This is an infinite level game.
